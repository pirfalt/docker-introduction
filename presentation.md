# Introduction to Docker

Title says it all, an introduction to docker. What, why and how.

Most of the time will be spent showing practical examples. Mostly of docker for development.

But before we get to the examples, I will go through a short summary of how we set up production and development environments without docker. And how it compares to the same with docker.

Docker Compose will also be mentioned, but Kubernetes is out of scope!

Desired outcome:

- You will know about the basic concepts of docker and how it compares to not using docker.
- You will have seen a few docker usage examples. And hopefully think about when you could use it.
